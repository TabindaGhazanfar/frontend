          Platform Purpose & Scope
        </h2>
        <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 mb-7 text-gray-800">
          EasyRent operates as a digital rental marketplace that enables individuals and businesses to list,
          book, rent, and exchange goods and spaces across various categories, including but not limited to
          real estate accommodations, electronic devices, speakers and sound systems, bridal dresses and formal
          clothing, household and event-related accessories, and other legally permissible rental products and
          services. EasyRent functions solely as an intermediary platform facilitating discovery, communication,
          booking, and digital payments between Users. We do not own, manage, operate, or verify the physical
          condition of listed items unless explicitly stated. The rental agreement and responsibilities rest
          solely between the listing owner (“Owner”) and the renting party (“Renter”).
